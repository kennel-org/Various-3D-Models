# utataneko-san's Electronic Project Bottom Cases

This repository features two distinct bottom case designs for the L-Chika board, each tailored for a different microcontroller configuration.

## Overview
- **ATTiny402 LED Case**  
  **Files:** `ATTiny402_LED.*`  
  Designed for the ATTiny402 board. This case covers the bottom terminals.

- **CH552T LED Matrix Case**  
  **Files:** `CH552T_LED_Matrix.*`  
  Designed for the CH552T microcontroller board with dynamic control. This case is engineered to cover the bottom terminals while allowing battery replacement without removing the case.

Both designs are provided in STL, STEP, and 3MF formats.
